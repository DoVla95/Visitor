              <h2>Paris</h2>
              <p id="Paris">
                The capital of France seems to have been designed specifically
                for the enjoyment of its visitors. Its streets, squares,
                buildings, gardens, and monuments beckon tourists to return, and
                indeed, many do. Some of the most memorable things to do in
                Paris include visiting the Eiffel Tower, the Arc de Triomphe,
                and Notre Dame Cathedral. During the evening, experiencing one
                of the legendary Moulin Rouge cabaret shows, strolling through
                some of the most picturesque neighborhoods, like Montmartre, or
                climbing the Montparnasse Tower is a must. It's always a good
                time to visit Paris. Depending on where you fly from, you can
                either make the most of the low-cost airlines flying into the
                city from other European cities or take one of its direct
                flights from further away destinations. If you have children,
                why not surprise them with a trip to Disneyland?

              <h2>Mexico</h2>
              <p id="Mexico">
                Mexico’s sun-kissed coastline has sugar-white sands at luxurious
                all-inclusive resorts, waterside Mayan ruins, and the
                technicolour Mesoamerican Reef. Turtles, whale sharks and
                coral-munching parrotfish are just a few of the marine creatures
                that can be spotted in the tropical waters here. Inland, there
                are active volcanoes, ancient pyramids, and fascinating cities
                waiting to be discovered. Its bustling markets are full of
                colourful decorative pom-poms and piñatas, stunning woven
                fabrics and wraps, and bargain ceramics and copperware. Travel
                out with a light suitcase and you won’t have trouble filling it,
                even if you’re not a big spender.

                Barcelona sited between the sea and the mountains, has found a
                formidable balance: a foot in the traditional things and the
                other in the avant-garde. Barcelona has the reputation of being
                the most cosmopolitan, modern and avant-garde city in Spain and
                it has renewed for the 1992 Olympic Games. While in Barcelona
                take a little time to visit Catalonia: Costa Brava owes its name
                of "wild coast" to the uniqueness of the sudden encounter
                between mountain and sea. Nature, climate and history, the
                picturesque of its ports and certain villages have been enough
                to have a worldwide reputation. Costa Dorada , in the south of
                Barcelona, it is the color of gold, luminous, being in the
                maritime littoral the reason of its name "Costa Dorada" (Golden
                Coast).

              <h2>Rome</h2>
              <p id="Rome">
                Rome (or Roma in Italian) is the capital of Italy and has a
                population of 2.8 million, the Romans. According to legend, Rome
                city was founded by the twins Romulus and Remus in 753 BCE. The
                city is located on the banks of the river Tiber and was founded
                on top of seven hills; Palatine Hill, Aventine Hill, Capitoline
                Hill, Caelian Hill, Esquiline Hill, Quirinal Hill and Viminal
                Hill. Particularly the area around Palatine Hill and Capitoline
                Hill would later become the centre of power of the enormous
                Roman Empire. You can find many ruins and excavations here of
                the Forum Romanum and the Colosseum gives you an impression of
                how gladiators had to do battle in this enormous Roman
                amphitheatre. The Pantheon, which is now a church, has its
                characteristic round, open roof and is one of the best kept
                buildings from Roman times. And the Via Appia takes you back in
                time along one of the oldest roads of Rome Italy. Basically, the
                city of Rome is one giant museum. It is therefore no surprise
                that the complete historic city centre is on the UNESCO World
                Heritage List.
